There are no robust indicators of biodiversity conservation that can be used to complement existing national indicators of economic and social health. The statistical methods which are used to model and evaluate the persistence or extinction risk of threatened bird species using citizen science data are reviewed in this study. Citizen science data helps to increase the number of records, thereby improving our understanding of the dynamics in declining bird species populations. Adhering to the PRISMA guidelines a comprehensive systematic review was performed using three databases such as; ProQuest Central, Scopus and Web of Science from January 1900 to January 2019. Only journal articles which analysed the persistence or extinction risk of threatened bird species using a statistical model, predictive model or a trend analysis, developed using citizen science data were included in this study. Bird species in near threatened or least concern categories that are declining in population or range were also included, since these may be the next wave of species to be added to the endangered species lists. Most of the 39 unique studies describing statistical models for this purposeused generalized linear models, followed by hierarchical or linear mixed models, machine learning models and persistence probability models respectively. A quality assessment tool was created in order to evaluate these articles. The review suggested several methods for measuring the persistence of threatened bird species, but there was no attempt to identify critical tipping points using methods such as changepoint analysis. The findings suggest that the persistence of threatened bird species varies depending on various risk factors which need to be addressed in order to produce better outcomes for the conservation of threatened birds. This review reveals the most suitable statistical methods for this purpose.","tags":null,"title":"Statistical models for the persistence of threatened birds using citizen science data: A Systematic Review","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Udani A.

Due to the lack of comprehensive survey data this study uses citizen science bird counts, extracted from the Atlas of Living Australia, to determine for which species climate change is likely to be more of a threat and to determine which species benefit more from protected areas. In all cases analyses are conducted using temporal models fitted using the Integrated Laplace Approximation (INLA) method. The trends for six local shorebird species were compared to the Australian Pied Oystercatcher, with significantly steeper upward trends identified for the Black-fronted Dotterel, Red-capped Dotterel and Red-kneed Dotterel. Also, while protected areas were associated with greater numbers of the locally threatened Hooded Plover and Sooty Oystercatcher than unprotected areas, there was a significant upward trend for Sooty Oystercatchers which was particularly obvious in protected areas. However, warmer years saw a significant reduction in bird counts for the Hooded Plover on the Mornington Peninsula. This work suggests that, with some limitations, statistical models can be used with citizen science data for monitoring the persistence of local shorebirds and for investigating factors that are impacting these data.

In 2015 BirdLife International estimated that 13% of bird species are threatened with extinction. Determining whether a bird species has become extinct or extant has become a difficult exercise due to survey efforts being too costly. However, due of citizen science data, the number of sightings has increased over the years (e.g. the eBird database increased by more than 20 million sightings from 2012 to 2018). The Hooded Plover is listed as a vulnerable bird species under the IUCN red list assessment criteria. In this study we compare two different models to identify the effect of climate on extinction risk for the Hooded Plover in the Mornington Peninsula in both temporal and spatio-temporal scales. Such models are needed for developing effective strategies to conserve threatened species while identifying the factors associated with persistence and extinction. In order to clarify the effect of climate on the persistence of the Hooded Plover we have used the citizen science data available from eBird, which has a large amount of validated observational data. The Hooded Plover is a non-migratory local shorebird in Australia. Therefore, we considered monthly data for our study. Initially probability of persistence model is used as a reference for determining the level of persistence for this bird species. To quantify any climate effects, we have considered the mean monthly temperature, and total monthly rainfall in Zero Inflated models and Hurdle models. To control the growth in citizen science data, we also included the resident human population of the Mornington Peninsula in our models. Citizen science count data often includes excess zeros for rare species like the Hooded Plover in specific areas or time periods. Therefore, we compared Zero Inflated models and Hurdle models using Poisson and Negative Binomial abundance distributions while using count data with temporal and spatio-temporal structures. In both the temporal and spatio-temporal models the performance of the Negative Binomial Hurdle model was superior. Similar conclusions can be drawn from both these models. Population has a significantly negative effect on average Hooded Plover counts (i.e. lower counts of Hooded Plover are associated with higher population) which means growth in citizen science effort, linked to population growth is negatively affect for Hooded Plover counts. The predictor variables of climate (temperature and rainfall) are not significantly affected for the persistence of Hooded Plover.
