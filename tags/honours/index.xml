      <description>&lt;p&gt;CLSA is the sole distributor of all factories and other brands of footwear and other related products. Lorry loads of goods are being received and dispatched to various locations employing number of employees. There is an incentive system to motivate employees to expedite loading, sorting, unloading etc. which was not effective.The aim of this research is to build a better incentive scheme to improve the efficiency and productivity of the employees. Monte Carlo Simulation and train a Neural Network was used for this purpose through existing details.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mathematical models for predicting debt repayment</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Debt collection is a massive industry, with in USA alone more than $50 billion recovered each year.
However, the information available is often limited and incomplete, and predicting whether a given
debtor would repay is inherently a challenging task. This has amplified research on debt recovery
classification and prediction models of late. This research considered three main mathematical, data
mining and statistical models in debt recovery classification, in logistic regression, artificial neural
networks and affinity analysis. It also compares the effectiveness of the above mentioned tools in
evaluating whether a debt is likely to be repaid. The construction and analysis of the models were
based on a fairly large unbalanced data sample provided by a debt collection agency. We have shown
that all three models could classify the debt repayments with a considerable accuracy, if the
assumptions of the models are satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Optimal Distribution Schedule for Lunar Clothing Manufacturing Company in Sri Lanka</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Lunar Clothing is a business enterprise which manufactures clothes for vendors who operates in six provinces named Western, Southern, Central, North West, North Central and Sabaragamuwa. Each province has a single hub and each hub has six clothing stores located in different places in particular province. Clothes are distributed to the vendors according to their request. Main store is located at Negombo free trade zone in Western province. The main objective of this study is to generate an optimal distribution schedule to minimize the total transportation cost. To achieve this, we considered three conditions such as size of the item requested by the vendors, the weather conditions of the local roads and the distance between the hubs and the vendors.The Lunar Clothing problem is one of the complex situations in shortest path Algorithm. This study is about the usage of traveling salesman algorithm for real world scenario. The entire problem has been decomposed to four major tasks such as dispatching the truck from main store to provincial hubs, assigning vendors for six stores in each provincial hub, transporting clothes from provincial hubs to vendors and dispatching ships to foreign ports. Then each and every task was analyzed and solved by using relevant algorithm. For mathematical modeling part and to generate the solution, Lingo software has been used. Some assumptions have been done in tasks for simplification. Then the optimal distribution schedule for Lunar Clothing has been implemented for processes in both inside and outside the country.&lt;/p&gt;
