My research demonstrates the need for understanding the effects of climate and protection of geographical areas on local shorebirds. It also demonstrates the need for understanding the interactions between local shorebirds and predators such as red foxes and cats for conservation purposes. Since researchers are saying that climate change is responsible for a substantial decline in shorebird populations, I have explored the effects of climate for local shorebirds in Australia. I have also explored the effects of protected areas for local shorebirds. These areas are key to biodiversity preservation, achieving good conservation returns.
This works suggests that statistical models developed with citizen science data can be used for monitoring the persistence of local shorebirds and for investigating factors that are impacting these data. This approach also shows some promise for monitoring the recovery of native species during conservation programs.">

      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p class="pub-abstract" itemprop="text">Bird extinctions are now occurring at a rate that far exceeds their speciation rate due to risk factors such as climate change, habitat destruction, overhunting and predation. When a bird species is lost, the benefits it might have afforded are gone forever. Population of many Australian birds are declining mainly because of habitat loss. Australia regularly supports 54 shorebird species and 17 of these species spend their entire life within Australia. We call these local Australian shorebirds including the Hooded Plover, Sooty Oystercatcher, Banded Lapwing and Masked Lapwing. Rapid decline in local shorebird numbers has been observed in the last three decades.
There are no robust indicators of biodiversity conservation that can be used to complement existing national indicators of economic and social health. My research addresses this important issue while developing a novel and reliable measure of persistence to identify threatened bird species worldwide. I hope that my research findings will help to create more effective and efficient responses for conservation of threatened bird species worldwide. Citizen science involves volunteers who participate in scientific research by collecting data, monitoring sites, and even taking part in the whole process of scientific inquiry. Citizen science can directly contribute to biogeographical knowledge and conservation policies by increasing the number of recorded species in large geographic areas. Citizen becoming a cost-effective alternative for acquiring high-resolution data and information. Therefore, I am using citizen science data for my research.
My research demonstrates the need for understanding the effects of climate and protection of geographical areas on local shorebirds. It also demonstrates the need for understanding the interactions between local shorebirds and predators such as red foxes and cats for conservation purposes. Since researchers are saying that climate change is responsible for a substantial decline in shorebird populations, I have explored the effects of climate for local shorebirds in Australia. I have also explored the effects of protected areas for local shorebirds. These areas are key to biodiversity preservation, achieving good conservation returns.
This works suggests that statistical models developed with citizen science data can be used for monitoring the persistence of local shorebirds and for investigating factors that are impacting these data. This approach also shows some promise for monitoring the recovery of native species during conservation programs.</p>
